[Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vTH6NWEMw6ph_fmRD9U0yMC6P5sk7Hc_/view?usp=sharing)

I'm a software developer and the Founder of [Acies Crest](https://aciescrest.com/), a [for-profit social enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_enterprise) that aims to improve the decision making processes for governance, economic and social initiative entities.

I also contribute to the [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) project and I'm a proponent to open source initiatives not only to improve the quality of software ecosystem but also personal improvement.

I'm proficient in Python programming language with interests in creating data pipelines using Apache Airflow, developing web applications using [Angular](https://angular.dev/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).
